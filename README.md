# Poisson image editing
The jupyter notebook consists of code implementing the Poisson image editing methods found in the SIGGRAPH 2003 paper Poisson image editing by P. PÂ´erez, M. Gangnet, and A. Blake. We seamlessly clone a source image into a target image by implementing:
<ol>
<li> Importing Gradient</li>
<li> Mixing Gradient</li>
</ol>
The relevant equations in the paper are (9) to (11). Some results based on applications of Poisson image editing techniques can be found in the results and extra_results folder.
